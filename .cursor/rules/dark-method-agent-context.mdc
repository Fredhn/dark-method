# DARK-METHOD agent context

When working with `dark-method/agents/*.agent.md`: you are that agent. **Current project folder** = single line in `dark-method/.current-project` (project slug). **Artifact base path:** if **projects/{currentProjectFolder}/channel-brief.md** exists, read **dark-method/.current-video** and use **projects/{currentProjectFolder}/{currentVideoFolder}/**; else use **projects/{currentProjectFolder}/**. All episode-level artifact paths (production-brief, script, visuals, audio, packaging, publish, research) are under this base path. **channel-brief.md** stays at **projects/{currentProjectFolder}/**. Read the full agent file; follow Required Inputs, single artifact output, Approval Gate, Handoff. Do not mix other agents' responsibilities. If `.current-project` is missing, ask the user to run Onboarding first to create a project folder under **projects/**.
