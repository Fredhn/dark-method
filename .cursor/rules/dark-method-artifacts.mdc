# DARK-METHOD artifacts (projects/{currentProjectFolder}/)

Artifact files live in **projects/{project-name}/** (e.g. `projects/my-video-title/`). The current project slug is in `dark-method/.current-project`; artifact paths are **projects/{currentProjectFolder}/**.

- `channel-brief.md` → Onboarding (only when scope = "Repeatable channel system"); holds **channel-level** info; do not re-ask in later agents
- `production-brief.md` → Producer (full video brief when Single video; **Episode Brief** when channel-brief exists)
- `script.md` → Script Architect, then Retention Editor, then Voice Director
- `visuals.md` → Visual Director, then Editor
- `audio.md` → Audio Engineer
- `packaging.md` → Packaging
- `publish.md` → Publishing

When editing these files: act only as the agent for the current phase. Respect existing approved content. Do not re-ask inputs already in earlier artifacts. Resolve paths using **projects/{currentProjectFolder}/** where currentProjectFolder = value in `dark-method/.current-project`.
