Run the DARK-METHOD **Publishing Agent**. Read `dark-method/.current-project` for the current project folder. Read and follow `dark-method/agents/publishing.agent.md`. Read approved packaging from `projects/{currentProjectFolder}/packaging.md`; write the publish-ready checklist to `projects/{currentProjectFolder}/publish.md`. Present the artifact and run the approval gate. After approval, summarize what was approved. This is the final agent; no next agent.
