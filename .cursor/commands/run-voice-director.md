Run the DARK-METHOD **Voice Director Agent**. Read `dark-method/.current-project` for the current project folder. Compute **artifact base path** per dark-method.system.md (if `projects/{currentProjectFolder}/channel-brief.md` exists, read `dark-method/.current-video` and use `projects/{currentProjectFolder}/{currentVideoFolder}/`; else `projects/{currentProjectFolder}/`). Read and follow `dark-method/agents/voice-director.agent.md`. Read the approved script from the artifact base path (`{artifactBasePath}script.md`); write the voice-directed script to the same path. For TTS (Coqui), call text_to_speech once per scene with **output_directory** = `{artifactBasePath}audio/` and **scene_number** = 1, 2, 3, … so the server saves scene-01.wav, scene-02.wav, etc. Include Manual Step for recording or AI generation. Present the artifact and run the approval gate. After approval, tell the user: **To run the next agent, type /run-visual-director in chat or select it from the slash menu (/)**.
