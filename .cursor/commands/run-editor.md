Run the DARK-METHOD **Editor Agent**. Read `dark-method/.current-project` for the current project folder. Read and follow `dark-method/agents/editor.agent.md`. Read the approved visual blueprint from `projects/{currentProjectFolder}/visuals.md`; write the editing playbook to `projects/{currentProjectFolder}/visuals.md`. If user uses DaVinci Resolve: create the Fusion Scripts Comp per-video folder at `C:\Users\frD\AppData\Roaming\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Support\Fusion\Scripts\Comp\{currentProjectFolder}\`, write Resolve API Python script(s) (e.g. build_timeline.py) and edit-instructions.json there, and instruct the user to run the script in Resolve (Workspace > Scripts or Console); otherwise include Manual Step for timeline assembly. Present the artifact and run the approval gate. After approval, tell the user: **To run the next agent, type /run-audio-engineer in chat or select it from the slash menu (/)**.
