Run the DARK-METHOD **Onboarding Agent**. Read and follow `dark-method/agents/onboarding.agent.md`. **First:** Ask whether the user wants to create a video for a **new project** or an **existing project**. **If new project:** Request project name/slug, scope, language, experience level. Create **projects/** if needed, then create **projects/{slug}/** and the six artifact files. If scope = "Repeatable channel system", create **channel-brief.md** and request **channel-level** inputs; write to **projects/{slug}/channel-brief.md**. Write the slug to `dark-method/.current-project`. **If existing project:** List the folders in **projects/** and let the user select one; write the selected project slug to `dark-method/.current-project`. Do not create a new folder. Present the Onboarding Summary and Consent, then run the approval gate. After approval, tell the user to run the next agent by typing **/run-producer** in chat or selecting it from the slash menu.
