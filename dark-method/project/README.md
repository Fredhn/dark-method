# Template files only

These files are **templates**. The Onboarding agent creates **projects/{slug}/** for each video project and copies this structure (production-brief.md, script.md, visuals.md, audio.md, packaging.md, publish.md) with the same headers into that folder. All artifact content for a video project lives in **projects/{project-name}/**, not here.

**When scope = "Repeatable channel system":** Onboarding also creates **channel-brief.md** in the project folder and populates it with **channel-level** inputs (channel name, positioning, default audience, default tone, format). **Episode-level** info (this video goal, length, topic) goes in **production-brief.md** (Episode Brief) from the Producer. See **dark-method.system.md** section "Channel vs Episode (Repeatable Channel System)".
