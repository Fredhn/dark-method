# Research (theme / topic)

This file is **optionally** created by the **Script Architect Agent** when the video theme is researchable (e.g. real events, league rounds, dates, statistics). It contains **only** facts obtained from web search or fetch. **Every fact must have a source** (URL or publication name). Do not list inferred, assumed, or invented content.

- **Theme/topic:** (from Production Brief)
- **Date of research:** (when data was gathered)
- **Facts and figures (each with source):**
  - Fact or figure — **Source:** (URL or publication name)
  - …
- **Uncertain or unconfirmed:** (optional; list anything that was not clearly confirmed so it is not used as certain in the script)
