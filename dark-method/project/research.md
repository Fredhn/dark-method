# Research (theme / topic)

This file is **optionally** created by the **Script Architect Agent** when the video theme is researchable (e.g. real events, league rounds, dates, statistics). It contains key facts, figures, and sources used to inform the script. Do not invent content here; only include data obtained from web search or fetch.

- **Theme/topic:** (from Production Brief)
- **Date of research:** (when data was gathered)
- **Key facts and figures:** (bullets or short paragraphs)
- **Sources:** (URLs or publication names; for verification)
