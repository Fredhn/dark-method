# Channel Brief

**Only for Repeatable channel system.** This file is created and populated by the **Onboarding Agent** when scope = "Repeatable channel system". It holds **channel-level** (general) information that applies to all episodes. Do not re-ask this information in later agents.

**Channel-level includes:** channel name, positioning/tagline, default target audience, default tone, format description, optional recurring structure, optional branding guidelines.

**Episode-level** (this video only) goes in **production-brief.md** (Episode Brief) and downstream artifacts (script, visuals, audio, packaging, publish).
